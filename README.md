## Usage

### Controller

To use the plugin, you have to enable the guard by calling `spamWordsGuard()` on the `$form` object.

For more information, check out the `kirby-uniform` docs on its [magic methods](https://kirby-uniform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guards/guards/#magic-methods):

```php
$form = new Form();

if ($kirby->request()->is('POST')) {
    # Call security
    $form->spamWordsGuard();

    # .. more code
}
```


### Configuration

The plugin comes with a few lists of words and phrases that are used to build a spam score. Thus the plugin should work out of the box. 

You may change certain options in your `config.php` globally:

```php
return [
    'tearoom1.uniform-spam-words' => [
        'addressThreshold' => 2, // the number of addresses like links and emails that are allowed, default 2
        'spamThreshold' => 8, // the threshold for the spam score, default 8
        'useWordLists' => true, // Use the default word lists, default true
        'spamWords' => [ // define your own spam words, the key number defines the weight of the words
            1 => ['promotion', 'free'], // weight 1, increases spam likelihood only a little
            6 => ['seo', 'marketing'], // weight 6, increases spam likelihood a lot
        ],
    ],
];
```

- The `addressThreshold` defines the number of addresses like links and emails that are allowed in the message. If the number of addresses exceeds this threshold, the form submission is blocked.
- If no addresses can be found, then the message is considered as safe and no spam words are checked.
- The spam score is calculated by counting the occurrences of spam keywords in the message. The score is increased by the weight of the keyword. If the score exceeds the `spamThreshold`, the form submission is blocked.
